# About GPUs

* It is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device. Wikipedia.

* They are becoming increasingly general purpose processors that can run programs (shaders).
* They are highly threaded and typically use SIMD to operate on multiple inputs at the same time.
* Still contain fixed function pieces for graphics-specific functions:
  * Texture sampling
  * Primitive assembly
  * etc
